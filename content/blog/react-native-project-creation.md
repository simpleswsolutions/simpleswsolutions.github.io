This blog's title is a bit misleading because it doesn't provide a
play-by-play set of instructions about the creation of a React Native project.

Instead, this post focuses on the options you as a developer have when you need
to create a React Native project from scratch.

Over the years various approaches have been used, starting with React Native's original 
'```react-native init```' and culminating with the latest ```create-expo-app```.

In this post I attempt to present each approach and point out its characteristics, goals
and hopefully provide a chronological or historical context.

## create-expo-app

## create-react-native-app

## react-native init

## expo init
